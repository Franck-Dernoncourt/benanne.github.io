My name is Sander Dieleman. I'm a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/) in London, UK. Before that, I was a PhD student in the [Reservoir Lab](http://reslab.elis.ugent.be/) at [Ghent University](http://www.ugent.be/) in Belgium. On this blog, I mostly write about machine learning, deep learning, music information retrieval (MIR) and recommender systems.

My PhD research topic was learning hierarchical representations of musical audio signals for classification and recommendation, with a focus on *[deep learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)* and *feature learning*. More information can be found on the [Research](/research) page. The PDF-version of my thesis is [available for download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/22bqmco45179t7z/thesis-FINAL.pdf).

In my spare time, I maintain [got-djent.com](http://got-djent.com/), a non-profit community portal website for fans of *[djent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent)*, an emerging trend in progressive metal music.
