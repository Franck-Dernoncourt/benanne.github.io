My main research interest is learning hierarchical representations of musical audio signals: finding ways to represent music audio to facilitate classification and recommendation by learning from data.

<!-- TODO: add an image from a paper  (spectrograms? k-means features?) -->

For this, I make use of feature learning and *[deep learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)* techniques. I also use collaborative filtering techniques for music recommendation.

A few selected papers are listed below, please refer to Google Scholar for [an overview of my publications](http://scholar.google.be/citations?user=2ZU62T4AAAAJ).
